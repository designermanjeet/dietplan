			<p>Tabuk, 28th April, 2017 General Module</p>
<p>Hi, I just finished my speaking tests two minutes ago. Quite confused if I got normal topic and I performed well. <img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="??" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/svg/1f641.svg"><br>
Examiner was behaving weird. He didn’t even talk a single word before starting the recording, in fact, he didn’t even ask for my view on recording my voice. That was rude!<br>
Questions were:</p>
<p>1. What’s your name?<br>
2. What do you do?<br>
3. What is your field of work?<br>
4. Why did you select this type of job?<br>
5. Which city are you from?<br>
6. Do you liked your city while growing up?<br>
7. Would you like to live in that city in future?<br>
Card:<br>
Describe a place where you go for sports<br>
Where is it<br>
What types of activities are there<br>
Why do you go there?</p>
<p>Associated questions:<br>
Do you support sports activities?<br>
Is there any other benefit than financial ones, in organizing international games? Why do you think so.<br>
Do you think international game increases friendship or it has negative impacts?<br>
Do you think society should compete to grow? (I didn’t understand that question)<br>
What are the good and bad things when society competes. (I was doing good and once this section arrived I felt so bad that I must have ruined my tests <img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="??" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/svg/1f641.svg"> )</p>
<p>Thanks Liz.<br>
Good luck for those who are preparing.</p>

			<p>IELTS Academic Speaking Test<br>
Barcelona 27 April 2017</p>
<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Part 1 I was asked about where I live, what my hometown is like, what makes it enjoyable. Also about mirrors, how often I look into them, have I purchased one, and if I like how they decorate a room.</p>
<p>Part 2 I was asked to describe somewhere I’d like to go on holiday: who I’d go with, what I would do, etc.</p>
<p>Part 3 I was asked more about holiday and traveling. In particular, I was asked how tourism can help holiday locations, or hurt them, and the most unexpected part was when I was asked how I would fix the disadvantages of tourism I had named (pollution, traffic, destruction of ancient or natural sites).  Good luck, everyone!</p>
